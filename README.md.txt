# PetFinder.my - Pawpularity Contest
In this project, I share my solution for Kaggle compition [PetFinder.my - Pawpularity Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-pawpularity-score).
Given images of pets, and images metadata, the purpose of the contest is to predict popularity of pets. High popularity means that the pet have high chances to be adopted.
